#### Function
		This is the point where a game comes to an end because one of the players has just won. That is, there’s an outright Win. Not when the game is a draw or there’s a tie between players. 
		One example of a win is when one of the players is checkmated, that is, the king is under attack and every move by the king will put it in check. Another example is when an opponent’s time has expired before they’re able to complete a required number of moves. Then there’s a win and that game will come to an end. 
#### Note:
        These are just two examples of how a win happens, there could be more.
